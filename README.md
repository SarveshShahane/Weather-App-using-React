# Weather App

My first React project for learning React fundamentals and API integration.

## What it does

- Enter a city name to get current weather
- Shows temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more
- Uses OpenWeatherMap API for real-time data

## Built with

- React
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- OpenWeatherMap API

## Setup

1. Clone the project
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create `.env` file and add your API key:
   ```
   VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
4. Start the app:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## What I learned

- React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- API calls with fetch
- Component props
- Environment variables
- Conditional rendering
- Tailwind CSS styling
